        <p>
            <strong><u>Attitudes & Behaviors</u>:</strong>  Ricky has a strong fascination with dreams and is eager to
            explore their meanings and suggestions.  Because he is reflective, he consistently writes down his dreams
            the next day.  Ricky is willing to share his dreams with his friends, demonstrating a desire to connect with
            others and be open about his experiences.  Despite not connecting with his friends on the topic of dreams,
            Ricky continues to seek out others who share similar experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong><u>Frustrations & Needs:</u></strong>  Ricky struggles to find people who share his interest in
            dreams, which leaves him feeling isolated and unsupported.  He is experiencing out-of-body experiences
            and is unsure whether they are dreams or something else, leading to confusion and a desire for clarity.
            Ricky wishes to find a group or community that shares his interest and experiences, so he can better
            understand them.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong><u>Goals</u>:</strong>  Ricky wants to connect with people who share his fascination with
            dreams and can relate to his experiences.  He seeks to uncover the meanings behind his dreams, hoping to
            gain insight into his experiences and how they might relate to his life.  Ricky aims to broaden his knowledge
            about dreams and out-of-body experiences, potentially searching into scientific or spiritual explanations.
            Ricky then intends to document his dreams, out-of-body experiences, and insights gained from his interactions
            with others in a journal, creating a record of his journeys.
