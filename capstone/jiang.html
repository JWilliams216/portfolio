    <h2>User Story</h2>
    <p>The admin user wants a ban function to achieve the goal of cleaning up the website of irrelevant posts. Enabling admin users to do this would deliver a more positive community and environment promoting dream posters to want to share more.</p>

  <div class="row">
    <h1>Interaction Flow</h1>
    <p>Jiang finishes up a long day of work and decides to log onto her dream account to review some of the most recent post submissions made that day to lighten her mood. Right after logging in she sees that one user in particular keeps submitting hateful spam messages to purposefully bog the server and prevent others posts from being seen. She makes an executive decision that this person shouldn't have access with their account anymore for posting and permanently bans that user. Bye-bye!</p>

    <h2>Post-condition</h2>

      <li>She navigates to the log-in section</li>
      <li>The site pulls up a login box, and she enters her admin credentials</li>
