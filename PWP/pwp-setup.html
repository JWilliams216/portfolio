        <p><strong>Audience:</strong> Individuals using and viewing my site would typically be parents stressing about organizing their life and maintaining their mental health at the same time, you shouldn’t have to choose between them. My site could be used by professional peers, doctors, therapists, educators, and anyone looking for tools and tips to manage their life better.</p>

        <div class="sty">
        <p><strong>Name:</strong> Tommy Thomas</p>
        <p><strong>Age:</strong> 31 years old</p>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong> Single dad of a five-year-old daughter, works full time at Smith and Sons construction company, and caretaker of house.</p>
        <p><strong>Technology:</strong> Prefers to use Apple products. Owns an iPhone XR with iOS 16, iPad 3 with iOS 9.3.6, and Beats Studio3 Wireless noise-canceling on ear headphones.</p>
        <p><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors:</strong> Works full-time at Smith and Sons construction company from 7am to 5pm. Tommy tries to be there for his daughter as much as he can by making sure he does her hair every morning, planning fun events whether it be a quick trip to the park or a visit to a zoo or aquarium. Tommy also spends a lot of time making sure his house is in order by keeping it clean, laundry, and grocery shopping.</p>
        <p><strong>Frustrations and Needs:</strong> Tommy struggles with being on time to events and remembering everything that he needs to have with him, whether it be snacks or entertainment for his daughter on long car rides, his keys or wallet, or leaving clothes in the washer overnight and having to rewash them. Tommy’s daughter is enrolled in daycare that provides her meals for her but when it comes to his health he tends to forget that he’s human and needs to eat and often settles for fast food that leaves him feeling awful after he eats it or doesn’t keep him full long. At night, after Tommy puts his daughter to sleep, he’ll often spend hours trying to play catch up on his household work, and before he knows it he only has five hours before he has to be awake and out the door, which leaves him groggy and unrested almost every morning. </p>
        <p><strong>Goals:</strong> Due to all the work, life, and kid responsibilities Tommy has to juggle each and every day he is looking for a way to manage it all without negating any of his responsibilities. He wants to be able to wake up each morning well rested, eat healthy meals to have sustainable energy throughout his day, and be able to spend the most time possible with his daughter.</p>
        <p><strong>User Story:</strong> As a single parent using this site, I am hoping to find tools and resources to help me manage my time efficiently and not feel so overwhelmed that I have to choose between my responsibilities.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional information Tommy may need in order to achieve his goals:</strong> In order for Tommy to achieve his goal he may need to speak with a nutritionist about which types of food would be best for his body. He could talk with his doctor about how to get a more restful night's sleep. Depending on his mental status he may consider talking to a therapist to help sort through his emotions and thoughts.</p>
