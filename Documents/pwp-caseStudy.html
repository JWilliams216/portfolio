                    <p>
                        I used Waterfall Development, there were four phases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Phase One</strong> was ideas for my website, originally I wanted my site to be for single parents, after talking to a few two parent households
                        I decided to make my site for all parents.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Phase Two</strong> was gathering content for my site, I needed to know how many sections and how much content I would need to display.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-6">
                    <p>
                        <strong>Phase Three</strong> was design, I started with making a demo site with filler text as a live wireframe to make sure all my content would fit correctly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Phase Four</strong> was putting it all together and hosting my site. I used my demo site to make any large changes to make sure I didn't mess up my project too bad before implementing it.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Technologies & Framework</strong>: HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS when I exhausted Bootstraps designs. </p>

                        <p><strong>Name:</strong> Tommy Thomas</p>
                        <p><strong>Age:</strong> 31 years old</p>
                        <p><strong>Role:</strong> Single dad of a five-year-old daughter, works full time at Smith and Sons construction company, and caretaker of house.</p>
                        <p><strong>Technology:</strong> Prefers to use Apple products. Owns an iPhone XR with iOS 16, iPad 3 with iOS 9.3.6, and Beats Studio3 Wireless noise-canceling on ear headphones.</p>

                        <p><strong>Frustrations and Needs:</strong> Tommy struggles with being on time to events and remembering everything that he needs to have with him, whether it be snacks or entertainment for his daughter on long car rides, his keys or wallet, or leaving clothes in the washer overnight and having to rewash them. Tommy’s daughter is enrolled in daycare that provides her meals for her but when it comes to his health he tends to forget that he’s human and needs to eat and often settles for fast food that leaves him feeling awful after he eats it or doesn’t keep him full long. At night, after Tommy puts his daughter to sleep, he’ll often spend hours trying to play catch up on his household work, and before he knows it he only has five hours before he has to be awake and out the door, which leaves him groggy and unrested almost every morning. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-6">
                        <p><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors:</strong> Works full-time at Smith and Sons construction company from 7am to 5pm. Tommy tries to be there for his daughter as much as he can by making sure he does her hair every morning, planning fun events whether it be a quick trip to the park or a visit to a zoo or aquarium. Tommy also spends a lot of time making sure his house is in order by keeping it clean, laundry, and grocery shopping.</p>
                        <p><strong>Goals:</strong> Due to all the work, life, and kid responsibilities Tommy has to juggle each and every day he is looking for a way to manage it all without negating any of his responsibilities. He wants to be able to wake up each morning well rested, eat healthy meals to have sustainable energy throughout his day, and be able to spend the most time possible with his daughter.</p>
                        <p><strong>User Story:</strong> As a single parent using this site, I am hoping to find tools and resources to help me manage my time efficiently and not feel so overwhelmed that I have to choose between my responsibilities.</p>
                        <p><strong>Additional information Tommy may need in order to achieve his goals:</strong> In order for Tommy to achieve his goal he may need to speak with a nutritionist about which types of food would be best for his body. He could talk with his doctor about how to get a more restful night's sleep. Depending on his mental status he may consider talking to a therapist to help sort through his emotions and thoughts.</p>

        </p>
        <p>
            I wanted to make sure my site looked good in mobile view, I had to implement a lot of break points and change the padding and margins to make sure everything fit correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
            I used an active sticky navbar so you could see each section you visited and by clicking the title of you could navigate to each one.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Results & Impact</strong>:
        </p>

        <p>
            Positive user feedback. Include testimonials or quotes from the client or end-users, if available. -I was going to see if Bobbi (Clinical Director) would review it and give me feedback

            <strong>Lessons Learned</strong>:
        </p>

        <p>
            The Cooking and Baking tier was the most challenging section of this project. When override Bootstrap to change the active color in my navbar and it changed the color of all my active statuses including the recipes. Over ten hours total were spent attempting to fix it, I had help from an alumni whose job is CSS, both of my instructors and no one had a solution. There was one solution that allowed me to add a color but I wanted the background to be white and no two colors together make white, I could've dug and found the specific parent/child div and fix it that way, instead of dwelling on it any longer I decided to reorganize the content to work with the issue.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Conclusion</strong>:
        </p>
        <p>
            I wanted a site where parents could get information, tips, and tools to help them manage their lives and mental health and am satisfied with the outcome. In the future I intend to..
