    <h1>Help Managing Life & Mental Health Case Study</h1>

<!--    rephrase-->
    <div>
       <p> <strong>Project Background</strong>:  I would like my website to be a place where struggling parents find tools and tips to help them get some mental clarity and hopefully leave feeling a little less stressed.
       </p>
    </div>

    <div><strong>Objectives</strong>:</div>

    <div>
    <p>
        <strong>Audience</strong>: Individuals using and viewing my site would typically be parents stressing about organizing their life and maintaining their mental health at the same time, you shouldnâ€™t have to choose between them. My site could be used by professional peers, doctors, therapists, educators, and anyone looking for tools and tips to manage their life better.
    </p>

    <div>
    <p>
        <strong>Development Process</strong>: I used Waterfall Development, there were four phases. Phase One was ideas for my website, originally I wanted my site to be for single parents, after talking to a few two parent households
        I decided to make my site for all parents. Phase Two was gathering content for my site, I needed to know how many sections and how much content I would need to display. Phase Three was design, I started with making a demo site with filler text and a live wireframe to make sure all my content would fit correctly. Phase Four was putting it all together and hosting my site. I used my demo site to make any large changes to make sure I didn't mess up my project too bad before implementing it.

    <p><strong>Technologies & Framework</strong>: HTML - structure, Bootstrap - structure and design, CSS to design when I exhausted Bootstraps designs. </p>

        <p>
            I wanted my sections to look similar by starting off with a positive note why each section is important... I also referred to a psychology color wheel when I was choosing the majority of the colors for my site.
<!--            each section's color and the "definition-->
            I wanted to demonstrate I could "hide" content within accordions and make my site look not so busy at first glance.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my "Children" section accordion I wanted to show that I could display content and links in various ways. Whether that be the text next to or below images and having the links be on the images or title.
        </p>
        <p>
            The "Cooking and Baking" tier was the most challenging section of this accordion. I had override Bootstrap to change the active color in my navbar and it changed the color of all my active statuses. Over ten hours total were spent attempting to fix it, I had help from an alumni whose job is CSS, both of my instructors and no one had a solution. There was one solution that allowed me to add a color but I wanted the background to be white and no two colors together make white, I could've dug and found the perfect parent/child div and fix it that way, instead of dwelling on it any longer I decided to reorganize the content to work with the issue.
