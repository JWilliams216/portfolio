        <div class="sty">
            <p>
                 I used Waterfall Development, there were four phases.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Phase One</strong> was ideas for my website, originally I wanted my site to be for single parents, after talking to a few two parent households
                I decided to make my site for all parents.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Phase Two</strong> was gathering content for my site, I needed to know how many sections and how much content I would need to display.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Phase Three</strong> was design, I started with making a demo site with filler text as a live wireframe to make sure all my content would fit correctly.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Phase Four</strong> was putting it all together and hosting my site. I used my demo site to make any large changes to make sure I didn't mess up my project too bad before implementing it.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Technologies & Framework</strong>: HTML - structure, Bootstrap - structure and design, CSS to design when I exhausted Bootstraps designs. </p>

                    I wanted my sections to look similar by starting off with a positive note why each section is important. I also referred to a psychology color wheel when I was choosing the majority of the colors for my site. Blue for purpose, trust, and security.

                In the <strong>Meaningful Activities</strong>  accordion I wanted to show that I could display content and links in various ways. Whether that be the text next to or below images and having the links be on the images or title.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the <strong>Support & Community</strong> accordion I have links in the images as well as the "visit" button on the bottom of each card
            </p>
            <p>
                In the <strong>Mental Health & Self-Care</strong> section I used a carousel and made sure the toggle arrows were clearly visible so no content was missed by adding a border to each photo.

            <strong>Testing & Quality Assurance</strong>:
        </p>
        <p>
            I wanted to make sure my site looked good in mobile view, I had to implement a lot of break points and change the padding and margins to make sure everything fit correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
            I used an active sticky navbar so you could see each section you visited and by clicking the title of you could navigate to each one.

            <strong>Results & Impact</strong>:
        </p>

        <p>
            Positive user feedback. Include testimonials or quotes from the client or end-users, if available. -I was going to see if Bobbi (Clinical Director) would review it and give me feedback

            <strong>Lessons Learned</strong>:
        </p>

        <p>
            The <strong>Cooking and Baking</strong> tier was the most challenging section of this project. When override Bootstrap to change the active color in my navbar and it changed the color of all my active statuses including the recipes. Over ten hours total were spent attempting to fix it, I had help from an alumni whose job is CSS, both of my instructors and no one had a solution. There was one solution that allowed me to add a color but I wanted the background to be white and no two colors together make white, I could've dug and found the specific parent/child div and fix it that way, instead of dwelling on it any longer I decided to reorganize the content to work with the issue.
        </p>

            <strong>Conclusion</strong>:
        </p>
        <p>
            I wanted a site where parents could get information, tips, and tools to help them manage their lives and mental health and am satisfied with the outcome. In the future I intend to..
