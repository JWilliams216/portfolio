                                            <strong><u>Attitudes & Behaviors</u>:</strong>  Ricky has a strong fascination with dreams and is eager to
                                            explore their meanings and suggestions.  Because he is reflective, he consistently writes down his dreams
                                            the next day.  Ricky is willing to share his dreams with his friends, demonstrating a desire to connect with
                                            others and be open about his experiences.  Despite not connecting with his friends on the topic of dreams,
                                            Ricky continues to seek out others who share similar experiences.

                                        <p>
                                            <strong><u>Frustrations & Needs:</u></strong>  Ricky struggles to find people who share his interest in
                                            dreams, which leaves him feeling isolated and unsupported.  He is experiencing out-of-body experiences
                                            and is unsure whether they are dreams or something else, leading to confusion and a desire for clarity.
                                            Ricky wishes to find a group or community that shares his interest and experiences, so he can better
                                            understand them.

                                        <p>
                                            <strong><u>Goals</u>:</strong>  Ricky wants to connect with people who share his fascination with
                                            dreams and can relate to his experiences.  He seeks to uncover the meanings behind his dreams, hoping to
                                            gain insight into his experiences and how they might relate to his life.  Ricky aims to broaden his knowledge
                                            about dreams and out-of-body experiences, potentially searching into scientific or spiritual explanations.
                                            Ricky then intends to document his dreams, out-of-body experiences, and insights gained from his interactions
                                            with others in a journal, creating a record of his journeys.

                                    <p>Dacre is always online, and spreads his use of social media over a few sites. He's never truly loyal to one and likes that he can make accounts anywhere. He really likes anonymous posting and frequents sites that make that easier. He prefers to read and interact with posts more than he likes to post his own. The only time he posts, its anonymous or under a psudonym (fedorathe_explorer).</p>

                                    <h1>User-Story</h1>
                                    <p>As a meme user, Dacre likes to share funny content he finds, more than making his own.</p>
                                    <h1>Interaction Flow</h1>

                                    <p> <strong>Use Case:</strong> Meme lord, Dacre Kellen wants to shut the world out for a while. He remembers finding good content on our site that has made him laugh previously. He grabs his laptop and makes his first order of business to check in with our website, (name pending).</p>
                                    <p><strong>Precondition:</strong> Dacre is on his browser, ready to look at funny content.</p>
                                    <ul>

                                        <li>Dacre clicks "login"</li>

                                        <li>Dacre scrolls down, and sees a post that makes him laugh to himself.</li>
                                        <li>He upvotes the dream.</li>

                                        <li>Dacre considers clicking on an emoji to react, but doesn't.</li>
                                        <li>Seeing the popularity of the post, he decides to take a screenshot to post to his meme accounts on other platforms later.</li>
                                        <li>He scrolls down to another post that has almost the same amount of upvotes, and continues his interactions until he is satisfied with what he has seen.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p><strong>Postcondition:</strong> Dacre has had a good laugh and decides to use the screenshots he took in a slideshow in his stories on another site.</p>

                                    <p>Jiang is an authoritarian, favoring or enforcing strict obedience to authority. She believes that everything runs best when everyone follows the rules, especially for a website. That means no posting on tags that aren't relevant and no memes in #general. She is an ENTJ, the Commander. Very decisive and well organized, Jiang takes pride in her great leadership skills and feels she knows what's best for the community's she is apart of.</p>
                                    <h3>Frustrations and Needs</h3>

                                    <h3>Goal(s)</h3>
                                    <p>Her main goals when moderating is to make all user's have an easy and positive experience. Bringing down the (hammer) of justice to all spammers and toxic users. She also dedicates her time to mediate any disputes between users.</p>
                                    <h2>User Story</h2>
                                    <p>The admin user wants a ban function to achieve the goal of cleaning up the website of irrelevant posts. Enabling admin users to do this would deliver a more positive community and environment promoting dream posters to want to share more.</p>
                                    <h1>Interaction Flow</h1>
                                    <p>Jiang finishes up a long day of work and decides to log onto her dream account to review some of the most recent post submissions made that day to lighten her mood. Right after logging in she sees that one user in particular keeps submitting hateful spam messages to purposefully bog the server and prevent others posts from being seen. She makes an executive decision that this person shouldn't have access with their account anymore for posting and permanently bans that user. Bye-bye!</p>

                    <strong>Testing & Quality Assurance</strong>: Insomnia was used to be able to test functions and help find bugs.

                <p>
                    <strong>Results & Impact</strong>: Dreamery has the potential to be a fully functioning app that is a space for individuals to post their dreams and connect with others regarding their dreams. Inn the future I want to implement some of the functions the timeframe didn't allow us to implement.

                    <strong>Lessons Learned</strong>: Code freeze is extremely important and no last minute fixes, additions, or merges should be attempted because it could break something else.

                <p>
                    <strong>Conclusion</strong>: Working as a team to create an app or website while learning the skills needed to complete the project has given me the opportunity to work on my coping mechanisms. First I will try to ignore the frustration and continue working, then take a step back and reflect on how to resolve the issue, then come back and address it with whomever necessary, and continue the work.
